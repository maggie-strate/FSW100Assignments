             <p> Penny's birthday was on November 8th.
                    We didn't have much money for presents this year, so we came up with a new plan.
                    Penny is a big fan of KCLD (local radio station). 
                    She calls into the station to tell silly jokes and requests songs.
                    She always looks for them at local festivals or activities.
                    So for a special birthday gift that money can't buy, we got in touch with them.
                    We asked if it would be possible to get a tour of the station. They said yes.
                    We got to the station and one of the DJs came out and immediately gave us swag.
                    They gave us a tour and even let Penny help DJ.
                    The look on Penny's face was priceless.hfdjshkfjhsdjkfhskdjfhskdjhfksjdhfksjdfhksdjhfksjdhfkjsdhfksjdhfksjdhfksdjfhksjdhfksdjhfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhsdkjhfksjdhf

        <p class="chessstory">In an effort to get my boyfriend to pay attention to anything but football,
            I thought I'd try to teach him chess.
            I have a lot of experience with the game, but my boyfriend has none. 
            I explained the names of the chess pieces and where they can move. 
            I told him, like all games, the best way to learn is to play.
            We proceeded to play.
            It was like teaching a monkey how to play chess. 
            He did not understand at all. 
            He kept moving pieces one spot on the board and trying to hop pieces to capture my king.
            He kept trying to make the game end faster so that he could go back to watching football.
            I did not let him off so easily. 
            I told him to play 3 proper games of chess and then he could go back to football.
            It was really funny to watch him and I learned a valuable lesson. I'm a terrible chess teacher.hjdsjhdkjhjdshksjhdf'

         We will get a hotel room on canal park.
         We will be visiting with my family.
        Hopefully we'll get a chance to see Santa Claus at Bentleyville. hjdsjhdkjhjdshksjhdf'
